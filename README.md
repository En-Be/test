This repo was to practice the process of initialising a project with git and rspec, making simple tests, and pushing and pulling from github.

This repo has been created locally, then pushed to github.
Then it was deleted from both.
Then it was created locally, pushed to github, deleted locally, and pulled back from github.

The tests were written to check first that the class exists, then that it's method exists, then that the method returns what I expect.

I'm confident this process is more familiar now and could be repeated without using any resources.
